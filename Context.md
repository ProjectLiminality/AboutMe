CHATGPT THREAD:

Hello. I have the intention to start looking for a part-time job that ideally matches very well with my profile, with my talents. And, yeah, for that, a few considerations that are going through my mind right now. Can I, like, YouTube, please help me kind of sort my thoughts and at the same time answer some of my questions? So, first of all, there is the question, like, I want to set up a CV, basically, showing what I have done throughout my life to be kind of qualified for the specific job that I'm applying for, which does include some, let's say, formal work engagements, but also it includes things like, yeah, things I have done in my own free time, like programming, for example, programming a Python library for creating 3D animations to communicate ideas, which is something I just did on my own, but I can present that. And, yeah, and then on a more professional side, I have worked, like, eight months for a quite high-profile organization that, yeah, it's high-profile, especially in the space that I want to find a job in, which is, like, the systems change space, you could say, or some people call it the meta-crisis space, but it's about, like, facilitating systemic change. And, yeah, there I basically worked in the capacity that, to me, is the ideal one, which was creating educational material through visual metaphors, primarily, like visualizing ideas to communicate the essential intuitions of concepts. So what I'm getting at is that I want to, yeah, basically present my qualifications, both kind of professionally, but also more this, let's say, private project stuff. One huge part is that I am working on a passion project of mine that, yeah, for many years now, that is somewhat known in that space as well, and I have a YouTube channel that is dedicated to this project, where, yeah, which basically, in some sense, also can act as a portfolio, yeah, showing the videos, the animated videos I'm creating, is using this Python library that I wrote, and I'm basically communicating really important but abstract or complex ideas about the systems change space and related topics, metaphysics included, in these videos, yeah. And so, yeah, that YouTube channel, even though it's more like a private thing, is definitely something that I also want to invoke in my CV. Yeah, but it's been a long time since I last created one. Last time was in university, and there was quite straightforward, because I was just studying. Now, having kind of left academia and navigated this more open space, it's kind of new to me how to package that. If I didn't have professional engagement all the time, but rather sometimes spend a long time just working on this project of mine and studying my YouTube channel and things like that, and I heard that it is important to have no gaps in the thing, in the CV, have like a gap-less storyline, which I can provide, but this, again, includes times where I was basically working on my own stuff. Yeah, so a lot of that is kind of floating around my head, like how to best approach it. And then, a big question is, I do have set up a LinkedIn, and LinkedIn sounds to me like it's made perfectly to present your CV and stuff like that. So I'm wondering whether properly setting up my LinkedIn profile is basically already doing the job, in terms of me not needing to create a separate document that I need to send to people, but rather just having the ability to contact someone and point to my LinkedIn page. Yeah, basically that's the question I have. And in that vein, on LinkedIn, connecting, showing my network might also be quite important or valuable. And so in that vein, I'm wondering, for example, all my former colleagues, when I was working for this high-profile project, is it like regular practice to just send them a connection request on LinkedIn? Yeah. And then also, I got pretty powerful testimonials from this project, which I also want to invoke. And also, as I said, my YouTube channel is kind of a portfolio of my storytelling and my talent for communicating complex ideas through visual metaphors and stuff. But I also have something like a portfolio, if you like, of individual visuals, rather than the stories where we weave all of those together into some larger story. And I'm hosting those on GitHub as separate repositories, and I'm wondering there as well what would be a good way to weave that in, to present that. Yeah. And also, for the last two years or so, when I was kind of exploring the wild west, you could say, just outside of any traditional academic or professional path, I was basically operating as a freelancer. I called the service Liminal Consulting, and that was the capacity in which I was working for that project. But basically, right now, my minimal LinkedIn setup, I'm very clearly communicating that my main project is what I call Project Liminality. So Liminal Consulting is kind of a sub-version of that. And yeah, to me, it's a powerful thing. Those people that know about it, they are always quite positive. At the very least, it shows my abilities for profound thinking and communication. But it's also working towards a concrete software, and things like that. And so I'm wondering, also, if it makes sense to keep that in there, because that's really what I'm about. And yeah, how would I best weave all of that together? That's kind of my question. Okay, I'll stop here. And please help me out on my thoughts, condense that down.
ChatGPT said:
Got it! You have a rich and unique background, and your challenge is to present it in a structured, compelling way that avoids "gaps" while highlighting both your professional experience and passion projects. I'll break this down into key areas and give you a practical approach.

1. CV vs. LinkedIn – Which One?
Use both. While LinkedIn is great for networking, many employers and clients still expect a traditional CV (PDF or similar).
LinkedIn as a dynamic CV: Think of your LinkedIn as a living document that can link to your projects, YouTube channel, and GitHub repositories.
CV as a structured summary: Your CV should be a concise, well-formatted document that gives a snapshot of your qualifications, projects, and skills.
2. Structuring Your CV
Since your experience includes formal work, freelance consulting, and independent projects, you want to organize it in a way that tells a cohesive story. Here’s a suggested structure:

A. Header

Name, contact details, LinkedIn profile link.
B. Summary (Short & Powerful)

A few sentences capturing your core expertise. Example:
"Creative communicator and systems thinker specializing in visual storytelling to convey complex concepts. Experienced in developing educational content, programming animation tools, and facilitating systemic change."

C. Experience (Reverse Chronological Order)

Each entry should include:

Role or Project Name – Your role (e.g., “Founder, Project Liminality” or “Freelance Visual Educator”)
Organization or Context – The employer, initiative, or freelance structure (e.g., “Liminal Consulting” or “Independent Work”)
Dates – Months/Years (to avoid gaps)
Key Contributions – Bullet points focusing on what you did and achieved
Example Entry:

Visual Storytelling & Systems Change Consultant
Liminal Consulting | 2022–Present

Created animated videos and educational materials explaining complex systemic change concepts.
Developed a Python library for 3D animations to illustrate abstract ideas.
Provided consulting services on visual metaphors for high-profile organizations.
Educational Content Creator
[High-Profile Organization Name] | 2021–2022

Designed and produced visual content to simplify complex topics in systemic change.
Received testimonials from top experts on the impact of my work.
D. Portfolio & Projects

Instead of a traditional "Skills" section, create a dedicated "Selected Works" section where you list:

YouTube Channel – Name + link
GitHub Projects – Highlight one or two key repositories + link
Major personal project – Brief description + link
E. Skills & Tools

Programming: Python, animation tools
Visual Communication: Metaphors, storytelling, educational design
Consulting: Systems change, conceptual frameworks
3. Handling "Gaps" in Your CV
You technically don’t have gaps—you were always working on something. The key is framing it properly:

When you were freelancing → Call it "Liminal Consulting" or "Independent Consulting."
When you were working on your project → Frame it as "Founder, Project Liminality" or "Educational Content Creator."
When you were developing tools → Position it under a relevant skill/project section.
4. LinkedIn Setup & Networking
Your LinkedIn should mirror your CV but with added interactivity:

Experience Section: Reflects your CV, but with more detailed descriptions.
Projects Section: Add your YouTube channel, GitHub projects, and major work.
Featured Section: Pin your best YouTube videos or GitHub repos at the top.
Testimonials: If you received strong endorsements, ask your former colleagues to post them as LinkedIn recommendations.
Networking Tips:

Yes, it’s totally normal to connect with former colleagues. Just send a short message like:
"Hey [Name], I really enjoyed working with you at [Org]. I'd love to stay connected!"
Engage with posts from relevant professionals to stay visible.
5. Presenting Your YouTube & GitHub Work
Your YouTube channel acts as a portfolio, so showcase it clearly:

Include it in your LinkedIn Featured section
Mention it in your CV portfolio section
If relevant, refer to specific videos in applications
For GitHub, choose the most polished repositories and:

Link to them in your CV's portfolio section
Feature them on LinkedIn under "Projects"
Consider writing a short "ReadMe" summary explaining the purpose of each project
6. Keeping Project Liminality in the Picture
If it's core to your identity and work, keep it on LinkedIn and the CV. One way to frame it:

Project Liminality | Founder & Visual Thinker (2019–Present)

Developed a growing platform for communicating systemic change concepts through animation and visual storytelling.
Built a community of engaged thinkers and practitioners.
Created software tools to support visual metaphors for abstract concepts.
If an employer asks about it, you can clarify that it’s a passion project but not a full-time role.

Final Thoughts
Your unique edge: You blend visual storytelling, programming, and systems change thinking—frame everything around that strength.
CV = concise, LinkedIn = expanded version. Both should tell a clear, gap-free story.
Make your portfolio interactive. Your YouTube channel and GitHub are strong assets—highlight them boldly.
Networking is key. Connect with past colleagues, engage on LinkedIn, and don’t hesitate to showcase testimonials.
Would you like a CV template based on this structure? Or feedback on specific wording?

You said:
Oh, this is wonderful. Thank you so much. I'm quite confident that I actually have a quite powerful CV to stick out. So now, the next question is for me. How to best kind of, quote-unquote, leverage my network? The reason why I'm not too clear about that is that I never really played that networking game consciously, but nevertheless, I guess, I did play it implicitly. So, I know a lot of people active in that space, but many of them, my most valuable kind of connections are more with people that don't really play that kind of capitalist networking game that much, which was also why I could avoid LinkedIn for the longest time. Yeah, but nevertheless, I'm going to use it now. And basically, let me try to put that in words properly. I want to find a part-time job going forward, and I guess for me, it's already one kind of unknown. Would I upfront communicate that when I apply for anything, or would I just apply, and then throughout the conversation, see kind of what options come up. If they only offer me a part-time job, I can just run with this. But if they offer me a full-time job, I might maybe even start working full-time and then ask for reducing my hours over time. Yeah, and also the reason why I want a part-time job is basically because I want to keep being able to work on Both Project Liminality, the software, as well as the YouTube channel, which, you know, includes communications around the software, but it transcends it, you know, communicating all sorts of important knowledge in that space. Yeah, so this is truly my life's mission, and basically now I realized that always trying to find some source of income that was directly connected to that was always kind of a struggle for me, which also blocked my ability to meaningfully proceed with that project. Now, basically what I'm looking for is some part-time job which really doesn't need to pay too much, like, already, if I would only earn €2,000 a month. Like, previously I worked for this project, like, 40 hours a month for €2,000, which was actually more than enough to support myself. I have a quite low cost of living here, though of course I'm totally, totally fine with earning more, and it is also appropriate as I proceed throughout my career, I suppose, to increase the money I earn. Yeah, but basically the reason that I want to only work part-time is because I have a mission, a primary mission, and now I'm just looking to support that. So how do I frame that in a way? Like, I guess I'm not alone in this, there are many people having that experience, and so how do you properly frame that in a professional context? Is it more, do you don't even talk about that? Why you want a part-time job? You just say, I seek a part-time job? Or might it even be positive to say, here's this unique gift that I want to give to the world, and I want to be able to keep working on that. And so I seek a part-time job. I still have space for that. Yeah, so that's one point. And then, yeah, then I'm wondering, I have basically, yeah, I want this process of finding a job to be a finite one. Because, yeah, I just want to find a good option. So naturally I will start with the highest resonance roles that I can imagine, which most uniquely leverage my talent and my passion, which would, generally speaking, be an educational role. Creating educational material for any given project. In the past, through my freelancing, my limited consulting, I have done so for each project at a time, meaning I would help any given project to communicate their visions and their idea, which actually is a quite finite pool, if it's only restricted to one innovation. But what I'm seeking for is a project that has basically a need for – yeah, that's basically almost more an academy-type thing, where they have – they want to keep on communicating something. So, for example, my previous employer was just active in the systems change space, and they wanted to communicate all these important ideas to the world. And so there was basically an endless supply of ideas I could visualize, which is the ideal kind of setting. Because, yeah, I would love to be able to work ongoingly for a project, or at least for a long while. And so, yeah. Basically, my goal is to identify projects in this space in general. Though most projects are listed on LinkedIn, I would say, relatively speaking, it's a bit more amorphous and kind of network-based, meaning, yeah, it's something where it's harder to find projects just through the internet. And it's, generally speaking, more easy, I would say, to – almost straightforward to, yeah, ask people in my network what they know about what projects might fit that criterion. And, you know, for close friends, it's really not a problem. I can just ask them and be transparent. But the more I go into the, let's say, more professional dimension, I want to be mindful to do that, to communicate properly. As to not, I don't know, cause any wrong impressions. So, what I mean by that is, I feel like there are ways to ask people if they know if there's any project out there that might fit my profile in a way that might not necessarily put me in the best light, I guess. Meaning, yeah, that gives me – yeah, I don't know, if people haven't heard from me for a while and then come and ask, hey, I need a job, tell me where I can apply or stuff like that, I'm just wondering if there's a wiser way to approach it or to frame it. And I think basically, ideally, it's about framing it in a positive light, which fundamentally is the energy behind it, which is just, I seek to contribute to the space in an ongoing fashion in some stable position. And so that from there, then I'll be able to also keep working on my mission. And so like everyone in that space, pretty much everyone knows me as the founder of Project Liminality. So, yeah, basically, I want a way to positively frame that and then just find the best project out there with the highest probability for me being able to work as an educator in that sense. And this is really, I would say, my most general key strength, is that literally anything, any type of knowledge out there, I'm able, I'm confident, very confident that I'm able to understand it and communicate it with a level of clarity that most people find surprising. So it doesn't even matter if I have a background in any given field, I have this general first principles type of thinking that I learned in my physics studies that allows me, and at the same time, this artistic kind of creative aspect to myself that basically allows me to wrap my head and heart around any type of knowledge. And then again, I have the skills to communicate it with 3D visualizations and stuff like that. And so that's basically the first wave that I want to address is that and then I want to progressively, you know, I just want to basically send out my CV, or like I want to apply for these jobs. And I guess another question would also be whether I would just write an email to them or contact them on LinkedIn or be more, if there is a possibility to get a recommendation from someone who knows my work, leverage that, like what's the best way to have the highest chances of being accepted for a given role. Yeah, and basically, then I want to set things up. And this is not something that's too relevant in the beginning, but I basically want to set up a process where I start with, like, I identify and start with my dream jobs, like for those. And then, successively, I basically cycle through, like, concentric circles. I start with the core, like what would be truly my dream role. And then I go to the next best thing, which might still be operating in that space. Systems change space, but perhaps in a less relevant fashion, meaning I wouldn't necessarily create visualizations and educational content, but perhaps, I don't know, do some other role which still leverages my talents of first principle thinking and maybe programming and stuff like that. But, yeah. And then, finally, the outer circle would be just any given project. It might be a totally normal, just a normal regular company. Working on anything that, I guess, boils down to just my technical expertise or my kind of technical mind that's able to solve puzzles as a physicist. You know, yeah, just programming, math, first principle thinking kind of thing. And I would, yeah, basically I want to set things up to structure this process to go from the innermost to the outermost circle. Okay, let me stop here. And, again, I ask you to help me sort my thoughts. Thank you.
ChatGPT said:
This is a fantastic approach—you have clarity on your strengths, your mission, and a structured way to search for opportunities. Your key challenges seem to be:

How to frame your part-time job preference without underselling yourself.
How to leverage your network in a professional and effective way.
How to structure your outreach strategy for the highest chance of success.
I'll go through each of these systematically.

1. How to Frame Your Part-Time Job Preference

The key is positioning it as a choice, not a limitation—you are not seeking part-time because you lack commitment, but because you are already deeply committed to a high-value project.

How to phrase it:

Option 1 (Direct Approach): "I’m looking for a part-time position that allows me to contribute meaningfully while continuing my work on Project Liminality, which is closely aligned with the same space and values."
Option 2 (Flexible Approach): "I’m open to different setups. Ideally, I’d start part-time, but I’m flexible depending on the nature of the role and long-term potential."
Option 3 (Framing as a Strength): "I bring a deep understanding of communicating complex ideas, and my ongoing independent work in this field sharpens my skills, making me a stronger asset."
If you frame it positively, most mission-driven organizations will respect your dedication rather than see it as a lack of availability. If a full-time offer comes up, you can always adjust based on the circumstances.

2. How to Leverage Your Network Without It Feeling Transactional

A. Who to Reach Out To?
Since your strongest connections are with people who don’t actively play the "networking game," you’ll want to approach this in a way that fits your community’s culture—more relational, less transactional.

Close contacts: People who already know your work well → directly ask if they know of any opportunities.
Professional acquaintances: People you worked with before but don’t talk to regularly → frame it as a mutual exchange rather than a request.
Weaker ties: People in the space you admire but don’t know well → engage with their work before reaching out, to build rapport.
B. How to Reach Out?
Rather than just saying, "Hey, I need a job, do you know something?" (which might not sit well with some), frame it as:

"Hey [Name], I’m currently exploring opportunities to contribute my skills in visual storytelling and systems change education. Given your insight into the space, I’d love to hear if you know of any projects or initiatives that might be looking for someone with my background. No pressure at all—just thought I’d reach out to see if you have any thoughts. Hope you're doing well!"
This keeps it open-ended, non-pushy, and positions it as seeking insight rather than just asking for help. People love sharing their knowledge and making connections, so this increases the chance of a helpful response.

C. LinkedIn Strategy
Engage before asking: If someone posts about something relevant, comment meaningfully to stay on their radar.
Soft approach: If messaging someone you haven’t talked to in a while, reference a shared experience or mutual interest first.
Follow up smartly: If someone says they’ll "keep an eye out," check back in a few weeks with a small update.
3. How to Structure Your Outreach for the Best Chance of Success

You already have a strong concentric circles strategy—starting with your dream roles and moving outward. Here’s how to operationalize it efficiently:

A. Stage 1: Ideal Roles & Dream Employers
Identify 5-10 dream organizations.
Direct outreach: If they have open positions, apply formally while also messaging a key person inside the org to introduce yourself. If no position is listed, send a speculative application.
Leverage connections: If you know someone inside, ask them for an intro. A warm introduction dramatically increases your chances.
Message Example:

"Hey [Name], I admire the work [Organization] is doing, and I believe my skills in visual storytelling and educational content creation could be a great fit. I’d love to explore how I might contribute—do you think it’d be worthwhile for me to connect with someone on the team?"
B. Stage 2: Broader Network + Word-of-Mouth Opportunities
Ask people in your second-degree network—those who know you but aren’t super close.
Post something on LinkedIn about your interest in educational roles (without making it sound desperate).
Keep an eye on hidden opportunities—many of the best roles are not publicly listed but spread through word-of-mouth.
Example LinkedIn Post:

"I’m currently looking for a part-time opportunity where I can apply my skills in visual storytelling, educational content creation, and systems thinking. If you know of any initiatives in the space that could benefit from this kind of work, I’d love to hear about them!"
C. Stage 3: Expanding Beyond the Ideal Fit
If you don’t land a role in the systems change space right away, move outward into:

Organizations adjacent to your interests (e.g., educational startups, research institutes, or mission-driven media companies).
Technical roles that leverage your visualization skills (e.g., data visualization, UI/UX, interactive media).
General part-time opportunities that allow flexibility while funding your passion projects.
4. Application Strategy: Maximizing Your Acceptance Rate
You asked whether to reach out by email, LinkedIn, or through recommendations. The best approach is a combination:

If applying to a job posting:
Apply formally.
THEN send a LinkedIn message or email to someone inside (hiring manager or relevant team member) to express direct interest.
If no job posting but an organization is interesting:
Send a speculative email with your CV + portfolio, positioning yourself as someone who can help solve a problem they have.
If leveraging a recommendation:
Ask your contact to introduce you with a short email.
Follow up personally with a warm intro: "Hey [Hiring Manager], [Mutual Contact] suggested I reach out to you. I’d love to discuss whether my background in visual storytelling and education might be a fit for [Org]."
Final Thoughts & Next Steps

Immediate Actions:
✅ Refine how you frame your part-time preference (choose direct or flexible approach).
✅ Make a short list of dream orgs & projects.
✅ Start reaching out to first-degree connections in a natural way.
✅ Polish your LinkedIn & consider posting about your job search.

Long-Term Process:
Follow a structured weekly job search rhythm (applying, networking, following up).
Track responses and refine your approach based on feedback.
If needed, progressively expand your target roles.
Your positioning is strong—your ability to explain complex ideas with visual storytelling is rare and valuable. If you approach this process intentionally, you will find the right fit.

Would you like help crafting specific messages or emails for outreach?

Based on all of this information, can you please write an infotext, or at least the first version of an infotext that I can use for my LinkedIn profile? Thank you.
ChatGPT said:
Sure! Here’s a first version of your LinkedIn About section, balancing clarity, professionalism, and personality while emphasizing your unique strengths and career goals:

About
I am passionate about communicating complex ideas with clarity and depth—especially in the fields of systems change, education, and first-principles thinking. My expertise lies at the intersection of visual storytelling, conceptual thinking, and technical innovation, allowing me to translate abstract or technical concepts into intuitive, engaging narratives.

Over the years, I have worked across multiple dimensions:

Educational Content Creation – Developing visual metaphors and animations to communicate key insights in systems change, metaphysics, and beyond.
Software & Tool Development – Creating custom Python libraries for 3D visualization, enabling richer ways to express abstract concepts.
Freelance Consulting – Supporting organizations in clarifying and presenting their ideas through storytelling, strategy, and design.
As the founder of Project Liminality, I have built a body of work—including a YouTube channel and software tools—dedicated to exploring and explaining transformative ideas in a highly accessible way. Previously, I worked with [High-Profile Organization] in a similar capacity, helping to visualize and communicate systemic change frameworks for a broader audience.

What I’m Looking For
I am currently seeking a part-time role where I can apply my skills in educational content creation, visual storytelling, and conceptual synthesis. Ideally, I want to collaborate with mission-driven organizations that value deep thinking, clear communication, and innovative learning approaches.

If you're working on something that aligns with these interests—or know of opportunities where my skills could contribute—I'd love to connect!

This version highlights:

Your core strengths in a compelling way.
Your experience with concrete examples.
A clear and inviting call-to-action for potential employers or collaborators.
Would you like me to tweak the tone, expand on any section, or incorporate specific elements (e.g., links to your YouTube, GitHub, etc.)?

You said:
Yeah, that's pretty good. So, the Python library for 3D animation, I have a GitHub repo for that. Would you just suggest to insert a link into the text at the appropriate location? How would you approach this? And then also, in the software and tool development, I would like to mention that I have, and yeah, tell me how that fits in well, but I have developed like a prototype for Project Libanality, which is a collective intelligence communication protocol, like a digital communication protocol enabling collective intelligence, basically. And yeah, for that I have developed like a prototype and a React 3 Fiber Electron app. I don't know how much detail makes sense to include here, but I also have a repository for that. And yeah, so let me know if you would include that. And also, my YouTube channel has also a link. And then Project Libanality itself has a GitHub account, which hosts also, it's incomplete at the moment, but it is hosting also the source files for my videos, as well as the software I'm working on and things like that. So yeah, how would you incorporate that? Please let me know.
ChatGPT said:
Great! Since you have multiple relevant links—GitHub repositories, a YouTube channel, and a Project Liminality GitHub account—here’s how I’d approach it:

1. Embedding Links in Context (Natural Integration)
For key projects, I’d mention them naturally in the text and hyperlink them where they fit best. For example:

Python Library for 3D Animation → Mention it in Software & Tool Development and link directly to the GitHub repo.
Project Liminality Prototype → Introduce it briefly in Software & Tool Development, highlighting the React 3 Fiber + Electron tech stack (but keeping it high-level). Link to the GitHub repo for details.
YouTube Channel → Mention it in Project Liminality and link it directly when discussing how your work is showcased.
Project Liminality GitHub → Since it contains multiple assets, I’d place this near the YouTube mention, clarifying that it houses software, source files, and other resources.
2. Keeping the Text Clean (Minimizing Disruptions)
Instead of flooding the main text with long URLs, I’d embed them in key phrases (LinkedIn lets you hyperlink some areas). If LinkedIn doesn’t allow hyperlinks in the main text, you could include a "Resources & Portfolio" section at the end with direct links.

CLAUDE THREAD:

Hello. I want to sort my thoughts a bit. Concerning my top, Jobs. That I want to apply for. Let's say, Projects I would love to contact whether they might have use for someone with my profile.

So further out from this Claude circle of amazing and aligned project. There are there is a kind of circle yeah, kind of regenerative, project, I would say. Where there are a bunch of, like, storytelling studios or something like that. Don't even know how to think about that well. But I have a buddy, Ryan That, actually, it's still we have an open conversation thread A storytelling studio that he's Kind of involved in I think it's up and coming in the future, but Yeah. There is basically There's a larger space of people that not necessarily have this very refined and you know, somewhat technical frame of the meta crisis based on complexity theory and powerful kind of but rather, like, a general feeling that The world has a lot of problems, Which kind of at the highest level addressed through finding And so yeah.

And I find myself that like, operating as a freelancer, which I have done so far, is actually really not The best way to approach things. Since I find myself basically, spending most of my time trying to Yeah. Find clients and things like that. And yeah, I noticed that in order to serve Now to serve mankind, more effectively I want to find Hey. Part time job, like, some More or less stable source of income. Just to cover my basics. So that then I can use my Remaining bandwidth much more effectively to Yeah. If you execute project liminality, And so there's, Chris Eddie, the assistant of Daniel from Actonburger. That I have a somewhat warm connection with and Yeah. Both him and Ryan, I would like to And yeah, explain my situation. In a positive light That I choose to now direct my energy towards Looking for a More or less stable position. Need to be perfect, but I want to look for a position, not a client as a freelancer. I want to shift gears. Into this other mode. So that I have more Basically, mental freedom and more. Predictability So order to then work On The software and the crowdfunding for that. And yeah. So I want to reach out to them and ask them first and foremost about Kind of the Network of projects that they are aware of since they both know my work. I want to ask them if they see any any projects that would benefit. From contributions from someone with My profile? Any projects that and foremost, we'd benefit from From, effective Communication Through visual storytelling, And, like, yeah. Education. Educational materials. In that sense, And yeah. But also, of course, What would be the best fit button I also have the qualities of, like, first principle thinking and system thinking and basically, I'm I'm keeping you trained n this whole meta crisis space So Yeah. I'm also happy to Phil, an adjacent role But, yeah, this is another thing. That comes to mind, which makes sense to do Yeah.

That's software that I'm working on. And and to to start a kick a crowdfunding campaign on top of that. And what I wanna do is For my peace of mind, I don't want to That's all my income on that crowdfunding campaign. It's an energetic thing that I feel doesn't feel good. I wanna do is to first get things ready so that I can so that I can Reach out to these top tier Projects. Or also, like, people in my network and stuff like that. Prior to that, it would make sense for me to have Have a resume, like a CV, Ready? And also my LinkedIn properly set up. Which also involves a bit of, clarification around How I can associate publicly with my former employer because I know that it was disagreement that I wouldn't associate myself as, like, someone speaking for, like, an official member of their team. I was just contractor basically. And yeah, but I imagine that they wouldn't have a problem because I got a testimonial from From Zack that which know, for me to use imagine they wouldn't have a problem me to associate myself somehow with them. I would like to figure out what level of association they would feel comfortable with on LinkedIn. And also, I can put that in my resume and stuff like that. But, yeah, there's there's a few things that need to be sorted out. And Then I can Basically, With that CV set up, And And the And my link, I'm properly set up. I then would like to reach out 2 a bunch of people, like, to this project. Ideally, through warm connections. And all of those out. And then there will be a wait time followed Following that, in which I yeah, actually want to pivot towards, creating promotional material 4 my crowdfunding campaign. Yeah. And so on that note, I have a Pretty detailed chat with Chad GPT. So that I would love to just copy over. 2 to this chat. So you can help me Basically, create a powerful CV. And, actually, on that note, I would like to know, like, I think PDFs are something that mostly people send through as a CV. But I was wondering about because, like, my work is mostly Animation is like my portfolio of kind of visualizations A lot of them are moving. And so, Is there a way to create a CV that is you know, That is accepted by the industry, let's say, wouldn't people throw people off Of guards. Off the rails so much. That allow for me to incorporate my animation somehow. So Yeah. For example, A website. Can I have a website that is my CV? I would love to host it through GitHub Pages. So That's how I like to do things normally. But, yeah, I should be able to Use your Help Your artifact feature To create a compelling Website. Can kind of quote scroll through and see my previous work and, like, who I am and what I've been doing, what my qualities are, and things like that. Yeah. It would be quite cool. And in terms of the content, like, the information, also that should be the right over from the chat GPT. Thread. Meaning I wouldn't even need to spend too much time to you kind of that part. And we could focus more on How to represent that nicely? Yeah. So What do you think? Can you can you sort my thoughts and also give me some guidance on this? Thank you.
Edit
You're taking a thoughtful approach to setting up your career transition and Project Liminality funding. Let me organize your thoughts and provide some guidance.
Your Current Priorities & Plan

Clarify how to reference previous work with The Consilience Project
Reach out through warm connections to target organizations
During the waiting period, focus on creating promotional materials for Project Liminality crowdfunding

It demonstrates your technical capabilities
It's free to host and maintain

A clean, professional landing page with your essential info
Interactive portfolio section with embedded animations/visualizations
Downloadable traditional PDF resume for HR systems that require it
Clear section on your experience with The Consilience Project (once clarified)
Project Liminality section (if you want to include it)
Next Steps

Example: "Visualization Contractor for The Consilience Project (2022-2023)"
Compile content from your ChatGPT thread
We can use this as the foundation for both your website and PDF resume
Build the GitHub Pages portfolio
I can help create this using HTML/CSS through the artifact feature

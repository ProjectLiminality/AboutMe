This rekindled my passion for using CGI and 3D animations in education. Inspired by pioneers like 3Blue1Brown, I developed my own [Python library](https://github.com/ProjectLiminality/DreamTalk) for creating powerful 3D visualizations pushing the boundaries of what's possible in educational animation.","x":-586,"y":675,"width":411,"height":300},

Hello. I want to take all of this information and, well, I will use it in one sense for creating a kind of regular CV. I also want to create a little kind of resume website that's somewhere between a portfolio and a CV where I want to weave all of that information together into a bit of a story of my life with an emphasis on the professionally relevant aspects. And, yeah, basically that would mean some chronological story that highlights how one thing led to the next and how all of these things that I did throughout my life kind of now all come together in my unique ability to help, yeah, to communicate knowledge with a level of effectiveness and accessibility that is, yeah, very unique. And, yeah, so you should have all the context of what has been happening, but let me on a high level quickly give you some thread and then you can hopefully use that to, yeah, craft a more linear storyline of how all of these pieces fit together. So, basically, I've always been, I have the type of mind that wants to understand the patterns behind the world I see, so I always had this kind of endless curiosity about how things work at the most fundamental level. And this natural pull towards first principle thinking. And, yeah, and I was always motivated to understand how things really work and how I could use that to basically make the world a better place. Always understanding things deeply so I can use my understanding for the benefit of the whole. And, yeah. At the same time, when I was about 11, I, by kind of peeking under the hood of computer games, I was playing like 3D games. Trying to figure out how they work, I got into CGI, like 3D animations and game engines. And that has ever since been a deep passion of mine. Mostly, where I was mostly fascinated by procedural animation systems and fluid simulations and the like. Which prepared me well for then my type of mind and my passion for CGI and computers and things like that. Also, I learned basically programming very early on in my life. All of this naturally led to me studying physics in university, where I further honed my ability for analytical and first principle thinking. And also deepened my foundational skills in mathematics, obviously physics, but also programming and computer science. In that study, the most important thing I learned there was how to properly think about systems and what it means to truly understand things on a foundational level. I finished my bachelor in the context of an Erasmus exchange at the University of Leiden. I studied at Heidelberg University in Germany, which is one of the leading universities in Germany when it comes to physics. Then I did an Erasmus exchange in Leiden for the last part of my bachelor. In my bachelor research project, I was able to combine all of the things that I was interested in. I worked in a quantum optics lab where my research was developing a novel approach. It was also very self-guided. I was lucky to have a supervisor that allowed me to freely explore what I was interested in. I was tasked with doing research on quantum tomography and quantum state tomography. Having the freedom to explore what I was interested in, I decided to take a novel approach to this rather computationally expensive process that is also highly relevant to quantum computing, which is a deep passion of mine as well. I took that and I optimized it. I learned how to build neural networks from scratch using PyTorch. With that, I was able to construct and train a neural network to do quantum state tomography for higher dimensional states where it very quickly becomes computationally intractable to do it in the analytical way. I derived a novel approach by combining quantum optics research with deep learning and neural networks and machine learning. That's the kind of highlights where I was able to combine my passion for programming, first principle thinking, physics, quantum mechanics, as well as machine learning and neural networks. I was basically blessed to be able to understand all of that from first principles and build it all from scratch by myself. Yeah, and then, um, after finishing my bachelor, towards the end of my bachelor, I discovered, um, a, um, an entire space of thought leaders that were exploring the intersection of complexity theory, systems thinking, cybernetics, and all with the aim of, um, basically, civilizational design, so, uh, researching, um, how our civilization can, uh, make the jump to a sustainable and humane system, um, that addresses all of the different issues and corresponding crises that we have. So, basically, um, I was, uh, getting into meta-crisis research, research how to address the root cause of all the crises that our civilization is facing at the moment, and, um, yeah, basically, in an autodidact fashion, using my first principle thinking and, um, studying the work of these thought leaders that were, um, gathering under the banner of, uh, Game B, Game B movement, I, uh, basically educated myself, um, about this truly cutting-edge thinking for how to meaningfully address, um, the challenges humanity is facing, um, up to the point, yeah, and from all of this, uh, yeah, and inspired by my, by my bachelor research project where I, uh, had the freedom to follow my curiosity and apply my first principle thinking, um, to, uh, to the intersection of, um, topics that I'm passionate about, I basically was looking for a way to, um, contribute to this space of thought leaders, and... ...which over time led, or crystallized into, me founding Project Liminality, and which is focused on rethinking the way that we share and relate to knowledge in our current civilization. Where I basically synthesize indigenous knowledge systems with open-source software frameworks and visual storytelling-slash-educational content into a truly novel system that can allow for the knowledge in our civilization to reach the right places and also be integrated with the right knowledge to come together into larger wholes to allow us to address the most meaningful challenges our species is facing today. One big piece here is also that, please put that earlier in the flow, at the part where I was talking about still being in university, that there I also found independent educators creating animated videos to explain topics with clarity that made knowledge accessible to me in a much more effective way than I was experiencing at university. So that kind of rekindled my passion for CGI and 3D animations and things like that for the purpose of education. So I was deeply inspired and passionate about this, using visual animations to convey knowledge. And that was then also the basis for me founding Project Liminality, which is basically the search for the system that I just described. A new and ancient way to relate to knowledge and how it can be shared and reached to places where it's needed most. And also cross-pollinate across disciplines, which is one of the most crucial bottlenecks right now, in my opinion. And all of that based in the modality of communicating knowledge visually and through the spoken word, just like these educational channels on YouTube, which also led me to create my own educational content on the dedicated YouTube channel that I created for Project Liminality. And all of that now leads me to being at once having this foundational capacity through my first principle thinking and later also system thinking, combining both the analytical and the artistic, like the left and right hemispheres of my cognition, into the ability to basically understand any topic out there. That's anything that I'm interested in or require to understand, I have the ability to do so. But then not only understand it, but also communicate that with clarity and depth and precision through visual storytelling based on the kind of 3D animation skills that I have, combined with also the programming skills. Oh yeah, by the way, I wrote my own Python library inspired by the Python library of a YouTube channel called 3Blue1Brown, which communicates mathematical knowledge in a truly, truly groundbreaking new way through creating these visualizations. He created his own Python library for that. And I basically, inspired by that, wrote my own complimentary Python library. It was more powerful when it came to 3D visualizations. And it's based on Cinema 4D in the back end, an animation software that I'm familiar with, having worked with it many, many years. So I'm very proficient in Cinema 4D, just using it normally. But then I took it to the next level and wrote a Python library that basically uses Cinema 4D as a back end to create a truly powerful procedural, infinitely scalable animation system. Which is the basis for which I am using for the videos that I'm creating, also for my YouTube channel. And yeah, which is all aimed at being used in, like this knowledge that I'm communicating is all kind of, right now hosted on YouTube, but will eventually be shared through the software that I'm working on with Project Liminality. Yeah, so with all of that, basically I have this intersection of both the, like making aesthetically pleasing visual animations to communicate knowledge. I have the ability to understand any type of concept, and then communicate it in a highly accessible way, focusing on the essential intuitions to make it as widely accessible to as big of an audience as possible, in an effortless way. And yeah, so this kind of combines all of the capacities and passions that I have. Being like the, like both the mathematical and the programming, the computer science, with 3D animation, CGI, as well as education, and yeah, clarity of thought, and things like that. So, basically I would say that all of this can best be summarized that I'm a futurist, that is, you can describe it in different ways, futurist is a label that makes sense for me. I'm a meta-crisis expert, I'm a visual storyteller, I'm also an educator, I have the skills to work as a science educator, but also basically communicate all sorts of knowledge. Yeah, so that intersection of all of these things makes me a very valuable kind of contributor to a wide variety of different projects that are aligned with this direction.

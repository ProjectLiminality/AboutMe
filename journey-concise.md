From an early age, I've been driven by an endless curiosity to understand the patterns behind the world, always approaching problems through first-principle thinking with the goal of making the world a better place. Based in Vila Verde, Portugal, I work remotely while continuing to develop my vision for more effective knowledge sharing systems.

My journey into technology began at age 11 when I started exploring how 3D games worked, leading me to discover CGI and game engines. This early passion for procedural animation systems and fluid simulations, combined with my analytical mindset, naturally led me to study physics at Heidelberg University, one of Germany's leading institutions, in September 2017.

During my studies (2017-2020), I honed my skills in mathematics, physics, and computer science, learning how to think systematically and understand concepts at their most fundamental level. I completed my bachelor's through an Erasmus exchange at the University of Leiden (2019-2020), where my research project perfectly united my interests. Working in a quantum optics lab, I developed a novel approach to quantum state tomography by combining quantum optics with deep learning, building neural networks from scratch using PyTorch.

While at university, I discovered independent educators creating animated educational content that proved far more effective than traditional teaching methods. This rekindled my passion for using CGI and 3D animations in education. Inspired by channels like 3Blue1Brown, I developed my own Python library for creating powerful 3D visualizations using Cinema 4D as a backend, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in educational animation.

Towards the end of my bachelor's in 2020, I became immersed in the work of thought leaders exploring the intersection of complexity theory, systems thinking, and cybernetics. This led me to research meta-crisis solutions and civilizational design, studying how humanity can transition to more sustainable and humane systems.

This culminated in founding Project Liminality ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@projectliminality2932), [GitHub](https://github.com/ProjectLiminality)) in 2019, which rethinks how we share and relate to knowledge. The project synthesizes indigenous knowledge systems with open-source software frameworks and visual storytelling to create a novel system for knowledge sharing. Through our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@projectliminality2932), we create educational content that makes complex topics accessible through visual storytelling. Our work has expanded into consulting through [Liminal Consulting](https://projectliminality.github.io/LiminalConsultingWeb3/) (2022-present), where we help organizations communicate complex systemic changes through visual metaphors.

Today, I combine analytical and artistic thinking to understand and communicate complex topics through visual storytelling. My unique intersection of skills - from mathematics and programming to 3D animation and education - positions me as a futurist, meta-crisis expert, visual storyteller, and educator.

I'm particularly interested in contributing to projects addressing humanity's most pressing challenges while continuing to develop Project Liminality's vision for the future of knowledge sharing.

Driven by a deep curiosity about the patterns shaping our complex world, I use visual storytelling and systems thinking to illuminate pathways toward a more beautiful future.

My Physics background (B.Sc. Heidelberg University, research at Leiden University) honed my analytical skills and first-principles thinking. This foundation, combined with an early passion for CGI and particle simulations, sparked my journey into visual knowledge communication. During my studies, I developed a novel approach to quantum state tomography, merging quantum optics with deep learning (PyTorch). Inspired by the power of animated online education, I also created a custom Python library for advanced 3D visualization to further push the boundaries of science communication.

Since 2020, I've been immersed in the 'GameB' movement and meta-crisis research. This led me to found Project Liminality in 2021, an initiative exploring how to fundamentally improve collective intelligence and knowledge sharing using open-source frameworks, visual storytelling, and insights from indigenous wisdom. Through its dedicated YouTube channel, I create aesthetically pleasing educational content conveying the core intuitions behind today's most important ideas.

Through Liminal Consulting (2022-Present), I partner with leading organizations, including the Civilization Research Institute and others in the regenerative and web3 spaces. I help them structure complex ideas and communicate their unique value using powerful visual metaphors and animations.

My core strength lies in synthesizing diverse concepts—scientific, philosophical, and artistic—and translating them into exceptionally clear visual narratives. I am eager to apply my interdisciplinary expertise—spanning Physics, Programming, First-Principles Thinking, Systems Thinking, and Philosophy—to impactful projects addressing humanity's most pressing challenges.

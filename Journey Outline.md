**1. Early Curiosity & Foundations**

• Always had a deep curiosity about the patterns underlying the world and a natural inclination for first-principles thinking.

• Early motivation to deeply understand things to contribute meaningfully to the world.

• At around age 11, curiosity about how 3D computer games worked led to an exploration of CGI, procedural animation, and fluid simulations.

• Learned programming early on, driven by a fascination with procedural systems and computational creativity.

  

**2. Academic Pursuits & Research**

• Naturally led to studying **Physics** at **Heidelberg University**, developing analytical thinking and problem-solving skills.

• Gained strong foundations in **mathematics, physics, programming, and computer science**, refining a systems-level understanding of complex topics.

• Completed an **Erasmus exchange at Leiden University** in the final phase of the Bachelor’s degree.

• Bachelor’s research in **quantum optics**, developing a novel approach to **quantum state tomography** using **deep learning** (PyTorch).

• Independently designed and trained a neural network to make quantum state reconstruction computationally feasible for higher-dimensional states.

• This project allowed for the fusion of **quantum physics, programming, machine learning, and first-principles research**.

  

**3. Expanding into Systems Thinking & the Meta-Crisis**

• Towards the end of university, discovered the **Game B movement** and the broader field of **complexity theory, systems thinking, and civilizational design**.

• Self-directed deep dive into **cybernetics, meta-crisis research, and alternative governance models** to explore systemic solutions to civilization’s grand challenges.

• Inspired by these ideas, sought ways to contribute to this space using interdisciplinary knowledge and skills.

  

**4. The Rediscovery of Visual Knowledge Communication**

• While at university, encountered **independent educators using animated videos to explain complex topics with clarity**.

• This rekindled a passion for **CGI, animation, and procedural visualizations**, but now with a new focus—**education and knowledge communication**.

• Recognized the potential of **visual storytelling as a medium to bridge complex knowledge gaps**.

  

**5. Founding Project Liminality**

• Founded **Project Liminality**, an initiative to rethink how knowledge is shared and integrated.

• Synthesizing **indigenous knowledge systems, open-source software frameworks, and visual storytelling** to create a new approach to knowledge transmission.

• Focused on **cross-disciplinary synthesis, collective intelligence, and knowledge accessibility** to help address the meta-crisis.

  

**6. Developing Tools for Visual Communication**

• Inspired by **3Blue1Brown**, developed a custom **Python library** for **3D mathematical animations**, leveraging **Cinema 4D** as a backend.

• This library enables procedural, scalable animations to illustrate complex topics with clarity and depth.

• Used this system to create educational videos for **Project Liminality’s dedicated YouTube channel**.

• Also developed a **React 3 Fiber + Electron app** prototype for Project Liminality, creating a **collective intelligence communication protocol**.

  

**7. The Present: Unifying Science Communication & Systems Thinking**

• Currently at the intersection of **visual storytelling, systems thinking, and knowledge communication**.

• Combining **analytical depth (math, physics, programming)** with **artistic intuition (CGI, animation, storytelling)**.

• Capable of deeply understanding **any concept** and translating it into **visually engaging, accessible explanations**.

• Positioning as a **futurist, meta-crisis expert, visual storyteller, and educator**, offering a **unique ability to clarify complexity and synthesize knowledge across disciplines**.
